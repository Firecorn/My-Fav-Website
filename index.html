        <p> Hello ,my name is Sruthi and one of my favorite hobbies is reading.I love to get cozy on my bed enjoying a great, interesting book.Reading is like a seeing a mini movie in you head .It is so awsome on how just few word on a page can create such beautiful picture in your head.<br><br>Another hobby I like is writing .I love how I can express my imagination by using couple of words.I love writing so much I actully have a blog.<br> <br> One more hobby I have is swimming .I am currently at a level where if I pass I can be on the junior swim team but because of Covid I coulden't do my swim test .Swimming is one of my hobbies I really miss.</p>

    <p> Wish is one of my many favorite books.It is about a young girl named Charlemagne Reese but goes by Charlie .Charlie's father is in jail for fighting and her mother won't get up from bed. Charlie is forced to live with her aunt and uncle ,Bretha and Gus while her sister ,Jackie gets to live with her rich best friend. It seems unlikely that Charlie's wish will ever come true.When she meet a skinny stray dog that she calls Wishbone and a a nighbor boy called Howard.Sudennly Charlie  is in serious danger of discovering that  what she thought she wanted may not be at all what she needs .</p>

        <p> Harry potter is a interesting book series . Each book is diferent and has a very different plot.I love the  Harry pottor's  series bcause J.K.Rowling,the author tells each Harry potter tale as if she was there wittnesing every single detail. And as I read her books I also feel like I am wittnising everything too.</p>
